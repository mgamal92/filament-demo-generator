## Features

- Add a **"Generate Demo Data"** button to any resource
- Custom modal with options:
    - Number of records
    - Optional: delete old data first
- Smart field detection using `fillable`
- Faker-powered values based on field types
- Supports text, number, email, dates, and more
- Success notification after generation
- Fully extendable — hook into the generator and customize as needed

## Configuration

You can customize how fake demo data is generated by publishing the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config --provider="Mgamal92\FilamentDemoGenerator\FilamentDemoGeneratorServiceProvider"
```
This will create a `filament-demo-generator.php` file in your `config` directory, where you can adjust settings like the number of records to generate, the fields to include, and more.

## Installation

```bash
composer require mgamal92/filament-demo-generator
```

## Usage

After installation, a **"Generate Demo Data"** button will be added automatically to the table header of any Filament resource.
