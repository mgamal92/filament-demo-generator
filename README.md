---

## Features

- One smart **"Generate / Delete Demo Data"** button added to any resource
- Dynamic label, color, and modal content based on state
- Custom modal with option to set number of records
- Built-in delete confirmation for demo data
- Caches generated record IDs for precise cleanup
- Fires `DemoDataGenerated` event after creation for extensibility
- Smart field detection using `fillable`
- Auto-handles `BelongsTo` relationships
- Enum fields are fully supported — random value selected automatically
- Faker-powered values based on field types
- Supports text, number, email, dates, enums, and more
- Fully extendable — hook into the generator or replace logic as needed

---

## BelongsTo Relationships

The package automatically handles `BelongsTo` relationships:

- If related records exist, a random one is selected and linked.
- If no related records are found, a new record is created and linked automatically.
- This process does not require Laravel factories and works based on `fillable` attributes.

For example, if your model has a `user_id` field and a `user()` relationship, the generator will automatically populate it correctly.

## Event: DemoDataGenerated

After demo data is created, the following event is fired:

```php
Mgamal92\FilamentDemoGenerator\Events\DemoDataGenerated
```

You can listen to it like this:

```php
use Mgamal92\FilamentDemoGenerator\Events\DemoDataGenerated;

Event::listen(DemoDataGenerated::class, function ($event) {
    logger('Demo generated for: ' . $event->model);
});
```

Payload includes:
- `$event->model`
- `$event->count`
- `$event->ids` (array of record IDs)

---

## Configuration

You can customize how fake demo data is generated by publishing the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config --provider="Mgamal92\FilamentDemoGenerator\FilamentDemoGeneratorServiceProvider"
```

This will create a `filament-demo-generator.php` file in your `config` directory. You can customize:

- Value generators for specific field names (e.g., "email", "phone")
- Generators by column type (e.g., "string", "integer", "date")
- Supported faker patterns

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require mgamal92/filament-demo-generator
```

---

## Usage

After installation, a **"Generate Demo Data"** button will appear in the table header of any Filament resource.

If demo data already exists, the same button becomes **"Delete Demo Data"**, and deletes only the records it generated.
